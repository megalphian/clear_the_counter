# clear_the_counter
Vision device to autonomously detect free food in an office kitchen counter. Can also detect dirty dishes left on the counter (S/o to DevFacto for the feature idea). Notifies the company's Slack channel of any food or dishes along with a snapshot of the counter

An effort towards a culture where sharing food is simpler and food is wasted a lot less
